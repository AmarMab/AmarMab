## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Computer Science undergraduate** with a strong interest in designing, developing, and analysing software-based systems. My academic focus is on applying theoretical concepts to practical problems.

Through my university studies, I am actively developing my technical skill set across a range of areas, including **software development, data analysis, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**. I have gained hands-on experience using **Python, Java, and SQL**, alongside tools such as **Git, GitHub, and QGIS**, to complete assignments and independent projects.

I approach problem-solving methodically, breaking complex tasks into manageable parts and refining my solutions through constant testing and evaluation. This has strengthened both my analytical thinking and my ability to implement ideas into working examples.

Alongside my technical development, I am committed to continuous learning and self-improvement. I actively reflect on feedback from coursework, explore new tools and technologies.
